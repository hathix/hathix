        I study computer science at Harvard, where I also dabble in the social sciences and political science. I chair the Finance Committee on the undergraduate student body government, built Harvard's first open data catalog (and an open data community of hundreds), TA'ed the intro CS course (CS50), and helped lead the edtech and international development tech clubs.

        I did UI/UX design and business strategy for Microsoft Project and Planner, two products in the Office family. At Project, the billion-dollar project management tool, I helped revamp the timesheeting system. And on Planner, I led the development of a first-run experience to improve engagement for 150 million monthly active users.
