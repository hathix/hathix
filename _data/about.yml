            Why is it called *hathix*? It comes from the Hindi हाथी *hathi* for elephant, plus *x* for the box. Plus, I always knew that the most catchy website names were two syllables, with an emphasis on the first (*Google, Facebook, Apple, Snapchat, Dropbox, Twitter*, etc.)

            It's pronounced like *hath-ix*: the first syllable rhymes with *bath* and the second with *mix*.

            By the way, tell me this trivia the next time you meet me and I'll like you immediately.

            I started skating at the end of freshman year when I discovered what a fun, fast way it was to get around campus.

            These days, I ride a Sector 9 Bambino, a 26.5\" cruiser (big enough to be comfortable, small enough to carry.) It's got 61mm / 78a Nineball wheels (yes, I like it very soft.) Ask me about the time I rode six miles at a stretch.

            *Life's too short to walk - get a skateboard!*

            I'm a diehard fan of the Philadelphia Phillies (my hometown team), and since I'm in Boston, the Red Sox are my AL team. Fenway Park is pictured above.

            My life goal is to go to a game at every MLB ballpark; so far I've just gotten four:

            * Citizens Bank Park, Philadelphia
            * Fenway Park, Boston
            * AT&T Park, San Francisco
            * Safeco Field, Seattle

# faq:
#     -   question: Why "hathix"?
#         answer: |
#             It comes from the Hindi हाथी *hathi* for elephant, plus *x* for the box.
#             Elephants are my favorite animal, but I still have no idea where the box came from.
#     -   question: How'd you start hathix?
#         answer: |
#             I started learning computer science (JavaScript was my first language!)
#             in the summer before my freshman year of high school (summer 2010).
#             I made a bunch of software I wanted to [share with the world](games.html),
#             so I published it on this site.
#     -   question: How'd you make this website?
#         answer: |
#             I discovered a fantastic tool for website building called
#             [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). That and the usual HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
#             with libraries like jQuery, Angular, and Bootstrap.
#             Check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hathix/hathix).
#     -   question: Any easter eggs on this site?
#         answer: |
#             Yeah! Click the "think inside the box" slogan.
#     -   question: How's Harvard?
#         answer: |
#             Better than Yale. But seriously, it's fantastic.
#     -   question: Pat's or Geno's?
#         answer: |
#             This is the one time I regret being vegetarian.
#             [Shoo-fly pie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoofly_pie) is good, though.
#     -   question: What kind of skateboard do you ride?
#         answer: |
#             Goldcoast 26" cruiser. Nothing fancy.
#     -   question: Favorite sports teams?
#         answer: |
#             Easily the Philadelphia Phillies. I root for the Red Sox when I go to Fenway.
#             Oh, and I support whoever beats the Cowboys.
