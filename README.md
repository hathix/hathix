# hathix.com
Code for my website, [hathix.com](http://hathix.com). Feel free to borrow relevant parts.

## Building
Make sure you have [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) installed. Then run:
- `jekyll serve` to preview the site as you edit it
- `jekyll build` to build the static, deployment-ready site.

To deploy the website, copy the `_site` directory to your server or run `deploy.sh`, remembering to install [duck.sh](https://duck.sh) and to change the FTP URL to that of your own site.

## Libraries/tools used:
- Jekyll
- AngularJS
- Bootstrap
- jQuery
- Underscore

## TODO
- Make portfolio and media pages (specifically the images thereon) more responsive
